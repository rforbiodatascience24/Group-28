When performing PCA, we'll want to perform the following steps:

1.  Looking at the data in PC coordinates
2.  Looking at the rotation matrix
3.  Looking at the variance explained by each PC.

We'll start by

```{r}
pca_fit <- biopsy %>% 
  select(where(is.numeric)) %>% # retain only numeric columns
  prcomp(scale = TRUE) # do PCA on scaled data
```
